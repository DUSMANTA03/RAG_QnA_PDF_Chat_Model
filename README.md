A **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) PDF Query Assistant** built using **Streamlit** and **Python** allows users to upload PDFs and ask questions based on the document content. It uses **Cohere's English 3.0 model** for text embeddings and stores them in a **FAISS vector database** for fast similarity searches. For generating responses, it leverages the **Cohere Light Nightly** language model, making the setup both efficient and entirely free to use.
